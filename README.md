# Presidential-Weather-Correlation
### Created By: Brandon Sharp

## Description
This program scrapes, organizes, and formats presidential approval ratings and the cost of severe weather events during a president's term and calculates the correlation between the two.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project was to determine if a president's approval rating correlated to the costs of severe weather events during their term. Although for most of the presidents that were analyzed had no correlation, it is interesting to note that Donald Trump and George H. W. Bush both had slight correlation.

## Future Development Goals
Another way of finding the correlation between a presidentâ€™s approval rating and severe weather events could be through the death count for each severe weather event, since losing human lives could possibly result in more of a stronger response to the United States citizens.

It also may be more beneficial to sepereate each president into each of their terms instead of combining both terms (if applicable) for this analysis.
