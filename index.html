                    <div class="overview_text">
                        <p>This study aims to analyze the correlation between a president’s approval rating and the cost of severe weather events over one billion dollars. For this, information for presidential approval ratings was collected from ‘The American Presidency Project’. You can find their website at https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/. The severe weather cost data was collected from the ‘National Centers for Environmental Information’. You can find their website at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/. The presidents looked at in this study were presidents Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George H. W. Bush. For each president, their is a graph for their approval rating and a graph of the costs of severe weather event disasters during their time in office. Additionally, there is specific information provided for each president for the correlation found. </p>

                        <p>The severe weather events data is freely accessible as a .csv file. The presidential approval rating was not. The only way to freely get their data was in the html of their website that they use to display it. To solve this, I created a web scraping prgram that scrapes the html of their webpage for each president, taking only the raw data for each president and formatting it in a text file. </p>

                        <p>To determine the correlation between a president’s approval rating and the cost of severe weather events over one billion dollars, I used the Pearson correlation coefficient from the python package ‘pandas’. I created two data frames, one for each president’s approval rating and the other for the cost of severe weather events. I then formatted their date of occurrence so that I could combine the two dataframes based on their month and year of occurrence.</p>

There could an amount of time that the population would react to a severe weather event, which could push the change in approval rating from a severe weather event to a later month than when the severe weather event occurred. </p>

                    <p>This study does not claim that severe weather events are the cause of drops in a presidential’s approval rating, but there is room to suggest that possibly after a severe weather event, the United States citizens are more critical of the president, resulting in a lower approval rating.</p>

                    <p>Another way of finding the correlation between a president’s approval rating and severe weather events could be through the death count for each severe weather event, since losing human lives could possibly result in more of a stronger response to the United States citizens.</p>
